Potential client records are typically created automatically when someone fills in a quote request form in your website front-end, but you can create them manually as an administrator too. If a quote is accepted, the potential client is converted to an actual client automatically, but again, as an administrator, you can 'promote' a potential client to an actual client yourself manually (whether or not they have any orders).");
